= Maintenance Windows

The maintenance windows feature in {productname} allows you to schedule actions to occur during a scheduled maintenance window period.
Maintenance windows can be scheduled to suit your calendar.
When you have created a schedule, you can select tasks that can only be performed during a scheduled maintenance window.

Maintenance windows require both a calendar, and a schedule.
The calendar defines the date and time of your maintenance window events, including recurring events, and must be in [path]``ical`` format.
The schedule uses the events defined in the calendar to create the maintenance windows.
You must create an [path]``ical`` file for upload, or link to an [path]``ical`` file to create the calendar, before you can create the schedule.

When you have created the schedule, you can assign it to clients that are registered to the {productname} Server.
Clients that have a maintenance window assigned cannot run restricted actions outside of the scheduled maintenance window.

Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running.
Restricted actions include:

* Package installation
* Client upgrade
* Service pack migration
* Highstate application (for Salt clients)

Unrestricted actions are minor actions that are considered safe and are unlikely to cause problems on the client.
Unrestricted actions include:

* Package profile update
* Hardware refresh
* Subscribing to software channels
