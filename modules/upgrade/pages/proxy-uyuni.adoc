= Proxy - Upgrade Procedure

Before you perform any proxy update, schedule a maintenance window.
The clients registered to {productname} through the proxy will not be able to connect to {productname} while the update is in progress.
For more information about maintenance windows, see xref:administration:maintenance-window.adoc[].



== Preparation

As a preparation step, add the openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} channels to the server.

.Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, use the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command to add the appropriate channels:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2 \
opensuse_leap15_2-non-oss \
opensuse_leap15_2-non-oss-updates \
opensuse_leap15_2-updates \
opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client \
uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-152
----
. Fully synchronize all channels with [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync``.



== Upgrade the Proxy

To upgrade a proxy you first stop the proxy service, then you replace the software repositories and update the software, and finally you restart the proxy service.



.Procedure: Updating the {productname} Proxy
. On the {productname} Proxy, stop the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy stop
----

. In the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy] and click the name of the proxy.
. Click menu:Software[Software Channels], and select the openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} channel.
. Click menu:Software[Packages], and select all the packages to be updated on the proxy, and then apply the selection.
. On the {productname} Proxy, start the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy start
----

If you need to update many proxies, you can create an action chain of this command sequence on the {productname} Server.
You can use the action chain to perform updates on multiple proxies at the same time.
